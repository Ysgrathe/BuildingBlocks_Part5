#  Getting into Unreal with C++ Part 5
> This repository supports the YouTube video [Getting into Unreal with C++ Part 5](https://youtu.be/wJo5tusarvY).  

That video is part 5 in a series aimed at giving people who want to use C++ with the Unreal Engine a helping hand to get started.
In this part, we add to the project, customising the player character class, adding properties, and using delegates to allow other code to be notifies when the values are updated.
